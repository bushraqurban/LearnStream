## Objective 🎯

The **LearnStream** app is designed to help users find Coursera courses tailored to their interests and learning goals. Key features include:

- 🏫 **Personalized Course Recommendations**: Based on user input, the app provides course suggestions that match the entered course name.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: The app offers a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily explore courses and get relevant suggestions.
- 🔄 **Responsive**: The app’s layout and components automatically adjust to the user’s device screen size.


## Setup and Installation 🚀

Follow these steps to get your local environment up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LearnStream.git
cd LearnStream
```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    
    On **Mac/Linux**:
    
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
    On **Windows**:
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate    
    ```
    
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4.  **Run the Flask application:**

```bash
python3 app.py # On Mac/Linux
python app.py # On Windowns
```

After running the application, visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to view the app.


## How It Works ⚙️

1.  **Input**: Users can select a course from a dropdown menu, which is dynamically populated with course names.
2.  **Processing**: Once a course is selected, the app processes the request and uses the backend to find and recommend similar courses.
3.  **Output**: The app displays recommended courses links along with details like ratings, institutions, and difficulty levels.
